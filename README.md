# Self-driving-Car-Project

This is a prototype of CNN in self-driving car. Checkpoint included.

What to do in the next step:

-Divide all the images into more classes for more accurate steering angles.

-Increasing the accuracy

-There must be some methods to do this in computer vision except for Deep Learning method.
